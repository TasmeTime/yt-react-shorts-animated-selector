I was doing a little experiment with IntersectionObserver to create a custom selector menu (a drop-down menu of some sort) for a personal project and I ended up coding this component which you can see in this repo!

### Using

- IntersectionObserver
- Styled components
- react hooks:
  - useEffect
  - useState
  - useRef
